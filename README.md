# Zhaav-Echarts

Repository for Echarts integration with Zhaav Ecosystem.






## ðŸ“£ Introduction to pyecharts
[Apache ECharts](https://github.com/apache/echarts) is easy-to-use, highly interactive and highly performant javascript visualization library under Apache license. Since its first public release in 2013, it now dominates over 74% of Chinese web front-end market. Yet Python is an expressive language and is loved by data science community. Combining the strength of both technologies, [pyecharts](https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts) is born.

## âœ¨ Feature highlights

* Simple API, Sleek and method chaining
* Support 30 + popular charts
* Suppot data science tools: Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, nteract
* Integrate with Flaskï¼ŒDjango at ease
* Easy to use and highly configurable
* Detailed documentation and examples.
* More than 400+ geomaps assets for geograpic information processing

## ðŸ”° Installation

**pip install**
```shell
$ pip install pyecharts
```

**Install from source**
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts.git
$ cd pyecharts
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```
## Startup
1. build docker image:
 ```shell 
 Docker build -t pyecharts .
 ```
2. run docker:
 ```shell 
 Docker run -p 8080:8080 -td pyecharts
 ```

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080**


## Objectives
1. create an API endpoint for each of the charts. this endpoint should listen for User's `HTTP POST` method and  render the chart. endpoint  implemented via Flask  and the endpoint should be able to handle multiple requests at the same time via RESTful API manner.
2. create a web page for each of the charts. this page should contain the chart and the API endpoint.


### How to do it?
1. Start page: Using `HTTP POST` and `HTTP GET` Flask method we can easily create first page.in this method we create function include chart names and by `HTTP POST` method we are abled to redirect to the each chart pages.
2. Charts page : For each chart we create a function and by `HTTP POST` we gather information from each web page.after that by using pyecharts we create a charts page.

## Charts Description:

This tables presents the description of charts on this project And what chart will it support according to   [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html) site.
